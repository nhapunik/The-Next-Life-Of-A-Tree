      <div class="paragraph"><p>Hi!</p> 
       <p>My name is Nick and I'm the person behind The Next Life Of A Tree.</p>
       <p>Since my childhood, I've been in love with nature and the outdoors. This is probably thanks to the fact that as a child, I've been brought up in one of the most unspoilt regions of Poland. I feel like most of my time as a kid has been spent walking and cycling through surrounding forests, camping with my dad and foraging for berries and fungi with my grandma and mum. This passion for nature has been with me ever since.</p> 
       <p>In 2016, I've begun an apprenticeship in North East England to become a joiner. Although   I loved my work, I quicky realised how much timber was wasted during the construction process. Whether thrown out as offcuts, or taken out during demolition, I felt it was sad how all that precious material would eventually find itself in landfill. But then,   I came up with an idea!</p> 
       <p>Why waste wood, when I can reuse it? As my apprenticeship initially began in a workshop, I had plenty experince with furniture-making. I began experimenting with what I could create from reclaimed and scrap timber. The results have exceeded my expectations!</p> 
       <p>Many years on, and still in the trade, I'm commited to doing my part in minimalising timber waste. And you can do your part too! By buying my products, you're not only redirecting timber from landfill. You are also donating to select charities, that serve to protect our valuable forests and other ecosystems across our globe!</p>
       <p>No wood should be viewed as worthless rubbish. Together, let's give it a new, next life.</p>
